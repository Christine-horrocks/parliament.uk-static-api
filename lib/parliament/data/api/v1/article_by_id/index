<https://id.parliament.uk/12345678> <https://id.parliament.uk/schema/articleSummary> "You can submit an oral question online using e-tabling. If you use e-tabling you do not need to follow the steps below. If you prefer to sumbit your question on paper, you should follow the steps below." .
<https://id.parliament.uk/12345678> <https://id.parliament.uk/schema/articleBody> "1. Use the [Question Time rota](http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-table-office/Oral-questions-rota.pdf) to find out what Question Times are coming up. The deadline for tabling oral questions is 12.30pm three sitting days before the Question Time takes place (or five sitting days for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales questions).\n2. Fill in a question form (available on the [intranet](https://intranet.parliament.uk/people-offices/offices-departments/commons-departments/chamber-committee-services/table-office/) or from the Table Office or Procedural Hub). When using the question form:\n\n - Tick the box to specify that it is an oral question\n - Fill in your name, constituency and the title of the relevant Minister \n - Tick the box if you have [an interest to declare](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmcode/1885/188505.htm) and email [tableoffice@parliament.uk](mailto: tableoffice@parliament.uk) to say what the interest is\n - Write the text of your question in the blank space on the form. Check it conforms to the [rules](https://pds-gtp-alpha.herokuapp.com/questions/rules-for-questions/#overview-of-rules). To table a topical question, write “T” in the blank space\n3. You can table [one substantive and one topical](https://pds-gtp-alpha.herokuapp.com/questions/oral-questions/#overview-of-oral-questions) question (check the rota to see whether there are topical questions for that department) for each departmental Question Time.\n4. Take your question form to the Table Office or Procedural Hub in person, or ask another Member to take it for you. Or sign the question form and post it or ask your staff to take it to the Table Office or Procedural Hub (faxed, stamped or photocopied signatures cannot be accepted).\n5. The Table Office will check your question is in order and contact you if they have a query. Once the Table Office has decided your question is in order and accepted it, it has been tabled.\n\n\n\n" .
